# 📈 Stock Price Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of stock market indicators to assess the technology sector, using data from stocks listed in the NSE and BSE for trend prediction. Leveraging Python for data cleaning, visualization, API frameworks, and statistical techniques, our program aims to identify the general trend of specific stock prices. The main goals are to reduce RMSE values, compare algorithms based on error, and enhance data-driven insights and decision-making processes. The analysis was conducted on data from over 15 companies, resulting in significant improvements in data accuracy and understanding of market trends.
